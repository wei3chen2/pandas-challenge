• To sum up, the data revealed that schools with higher budgets, didn’t out-perform schools with smaller budgets. Smaller and medium sized school tend to yield better test results. The top 5 schools are all charter schools while the bottom 5 all district schools are observed. 

• Observations and analysis:

The dataset encompasses a total of 15 schools, 39,170 students, with a total budget $24,649,428. The total students average reading score is 81.88 while the average math score is 78.99. The passing rate reading is 85.81%, passing rate math is 74.98 %, and hence the overall passing rate is 65.17%.
The school summary report shows that among all the school, Cabrera high school , a charter school, with a total student of 1858, out-performs all the other schools with the highest overall passing rate 91.33%. At the meantime, the maximum budget is 
248,087.00 its Holden High School.
The findings from the data show that schools with higher budgets per student, actually don’t yield better test results. By contrast, while schools spending per student increase, student's average math and reading score, rate of passing math and reading, both decrease.
The data revealed that smaller and medium sized schools obviously out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%). As a conclusion, when school size becomes bigger, it will negatively influence student achievement.
The other finding of this analysis is that as a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, this finding commences investigating the motivators for academic achievement: such as smaller size of the charter school, more school practices, or other reasons, and give an open space for researchers to work more on this.
